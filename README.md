# ObjectDetection_Cat
Object detection using Tensorflow Object Detection API.

## References

This project is based in the tutorial provided in : https://gilberttanner.com/blog/object-detection-with-tensorflow-2/

The notebook was run using google colab in a different dataset

## Dataset

The dataset is comprised of 107 images and 107 annotations. Part of the images was aquired via google images and the remaining are personal images of my pet cat or pictures I had saved from other cats.

## Model

The model used was EfficientDet D0 512x512, that was used in the tutorial. The model was already pretrained on the coco dataset and it is then downloaded and trained again on my own dataset.
